# CHORUS
CHORUS is a system for those who think in constellations, not straight lines. It offers structure without rigidity and clarity without collapse. Itâ€™s a modular, visual, and non-linear method for organizing notes and a way of navigating your own cognition.

Built from **chunks**, not outlines, it uses **shape** and **color** for emotional and structural resonance. It honors *how* you think, not how youâ€™re told to write.
